<h1 id="policies">Policies</h1>
<h3 id="overview" permalink="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Policies in Sails are versatile tools for authorization and access control-- they let you allow or deny access to your controllers down to a fine level of granularity.  For example, if you were building Dropbox, before letting a user upload a file to a folder, you might check that she <code>isAuthenticated</code>, then ensure that she <code>canWrite</code> (has write permissions on the folder.)  Finally, you&apos;d want to check that the folder she&apos;s uploading into <code>hasEnoughSpace</code>.</p>
<p>Policies can be used for anything: HTTP BasicAuth, 3rd party single-sign-on, OAuth 2.0, or your own custom authorization/authentication scheme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: policies apply <strong>only</strong> to controller actions, not to views.  If you define a route in your <a href="http://beta.sailsjs.org/#/documentation/reference/sails.config/sails.config.routes.html" target="_blank">routes.js config file</a> that points directly to a view, no policies will be applied to it.  To make sure policies are applied, you can instead define a controller action which displays your view, and point your route to that action.</p>

<h3 id="writing-your-first-policy" permalink="writing-your-first-policy">Writing Your First Policy</h3>
<p>Policies are files defined in the <code>api/policies</code> folder in your Sails app.  Each policy file should contain a single function.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, policies are really just Connect/Express middleware functions which run <strong>before</strong> your controllers.  You can chain as many of them together as you like-- in fact they&apos;re designed to be used this way.  Ideally, each middleware function should really check just <em>one thing</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>canWrite</code> policy mentioned above might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">// policies/canWrite.js
module.exports = function canWrite (req, res, next) {
  var targetFolderId = req.param(&apos;id&apos;);
  var userId = req.session.user.id;

  Permission
  .findOneByFolderId( targetFolderId )
  .exec( function foundPermission (err, permission) {

    // Unexpected error occurred-- skip to the app&apos;s default error (500) handler
    if (err) return next(err);

    // No permission exists linking this user to this folder.  Maybe they got removed from it?  Maybe they never had permission in the first place?  Who cares?
    if ( ! permission ) return res.redirect(&apos;/notAllowed&apos;);

    // OK, so a permission was found.  Let&apos;s be sure it&apos;s a &quot;write&quot;.
    if ( permission.type !== &apos;write&apos; ) return res.redirect(&apos;/notAllowed&apos;);

    // If we made it all the way down here, looks like everything&apos;s ok, so we&apos;ll let the user through
    next();
  });
};

<h3 id="protecting-controllers-with-policies" permalink="protecting-controllers-with-policies">Protecting Controllers with Policies</h3>
<p>Sails has a built in ACL (access control list) located in <code>config/policies.js</code>.  This file is used to map policies to your controllers.  </p>
<p>This file is  <em>declarative</em>, meaning it describes <em>what</em> the permissions for your app should look like, not <em>how</em> they should work.  This makes it easier for new developers to jump in and understand what&apos;s going on, plus it makes your app more flexible as your requirements inevitably change over time.</p>
<p>Your <code>config/policies.js</code> file should export a Javascript object whose keys are controller names (or <code>&apos;*&apos;</code> for  global policies), and whose values are objects mapping action names to one or more policies.  See below for more details and examples.</p>

<h3 id="built-in-policies" permalink="builtin-policies">Built-in policies</h3>
<p>Sails provides two built-in policies that can be applied globally, or to a specific controller or action.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code>: public access  (allows anyone to get to the mapped controller/action)</li>
<li><p><code>false</code>: <strong>NO</strong> access (allows <strong>no-one</strong> to access the mapped controller/action)</p>
<p><code>&apos;*&apos;: true</code> is the default policy for all controllers and actions.  In production, it&apos;s good practice to set this to <code>false</code> to prevent access to any logic you might have inadvertently exposed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="adding-some-policies-to-a-controller-" permalink="adding-some-policies-to-a-controller">Adding some policies to a controller:</h5>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">// in config/policies.js

  // ...
  RabbitController: {

    // Apply the `false` policy as the default for all of RabbitController&apos;s actions
    // (`false` prevents all access, which ensures that nothing bad happens to our rabbits)
    &apos;*&apos;: false,

    // For the action `nurture`, apply the &apos;isRabbitMother&apos; policy 
    // (this overrides `false` above)
    nurture : &apos;isRabbitMother&apos;,

    // Apply the `isNiceToAnimals` AND `hasRabbitFood` policies
    // before letting any users feed our rabbits
    feed : [&apos;isNiceToAnimals&apos;, &apos;hasRabbitFood&apos;]
  }
  // ...
</code></pre><!-- __LANG=%%__ -->
<p>Here&#x2019;s what the <code>isNiceToAnimals</code> policy from above might look like (this file would be located at <code>policies/isNiceToAnimals.js</code>):</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">module.exports = function isNiceToAnimals (req, res, next) {

  // `req.session` contains a set of data specific to the user making this request.
  // It&apos;s kind of like our app&apos;s &quot;memory&quot; of the current user.

  // If our user has a history of animal cruelty, not only will we 
  // prevent her from going even one step further (`return`), 
  // we&apos;ll go ahead and redirect her to PETA (`res.redirect`).
  if ( req.session.user.hasHistoryOfAnimalCruelty ) {
    return res.redirect(&apos;http://PETA.org&apos;);
  }

  // If the user has been seen frowning at puppies, we have to assume that
  // they might end up being mean to them, so we&apos;ll 
  if ( req.session.user.frownsAtPuppies ) {
    return res.redirect(&apos;http://www.dailypuppy.com/&apos;);
  }

  // Finally, if the user has a clean record, we&apos;ll call the `next()` function
  // to let them through to the next policy or our controller
  next();
};
</code></pre><!-- __LANG=%%__ -->
<p>Besides protecting rabbits (while a noble cause, no doubt), here are a few other use cases for policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>cookie-based authentication</li>
<li>role-based access control</li>
<li>limiting file uploads based on MB quotas</li>
<li>any other kind of authentication scheme you can imagine</li>
</ul>

<p>Passport works great with Sails!  In general, since Sails uses Connect/Express at its core, all of the Connect/Express-oriented things work pretty well.  In fact, Sails has no problem interpreting most Express middleware to work with socket.io.</p>
