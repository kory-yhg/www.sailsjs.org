<h1>Socket Client (<code>sails.io.js</code>)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>This section of the docs is about the Sails socket client SDK for the browser.  It is written in JavaScript and is also usable on the server.</p>
<p>There are also a handful of community projects implementing Sails/Socket.io clients for native iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Sails socket client (<a href="https://github.com/balderdashy/sails.io.js"><code>sails.io.js</code></a>) is a tiny browser library that is bundled by default in new Sails apps.  It is a lightweight wrapper that sits on top of the Socket.IO client whose purpose is to make sending and receiving messages from your Sails backend as simple as possible.</p>
<p>The main responsibility of <code>sails.io.js</code> is to provide a familiar ajax-like interface for communicating with your Sails app using WebSockets/Socket.io.  That basically means providing <code>.get()</code>, <code>.post()</code>, <code>.put()</code>, and <code>.delete()</code> methods that let you take advantage of realtime features while still reusing the same backend routes you're using for the rest of your app.  In other words, running <code>io.socket.post('/user')</code> in your browser will be routed within your Sails app exactly the same as an HTTP POST request to the same route.</p>
<h3>Can I use this with...</h3>
<p>Yes.  The Sails socket client can be used to great effect with any front-end framework-- no matter whether it's angular, backbone, ember, knockout, etc.</p>
<h3>Do I have to use this?</h3>
<p>No. The Sails socket client is extremely helpful when building realtime/chat features in a browser-based UI, but like the rest of the <code>assets/</code> directory, it is probably not particularly useful if you are building a native Android app, or an API with no user interface.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like every other boilerplate file and folder in Sails, the socket client is completely optional. To remove it, just delete <code>assets/js/dependencies/sails.io.js</code>.</p>
<!--
  TODO: add a bit more of a technical description in here at some point
Under the covers, sails.io.js emits Socket.io messages with reserved names that, when interpreted by Sails, are routed to the appropriate policies/controllers/etc. according to your app's routes and blueprint configuration.
