	<h1>Changelog 0.8.7x</h1>
	<h3>0.8.79</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Adapter definitions are no longer functions-- instead the direct definition object is accepted. This makes it easier, cleaner, and more declarative to create adapters.</li>
		<li>Merged waterline into main Sails repo.</li>
		<li>Brought in sails-util and sails-moduleloader, moved watelrine tests into top level.</li>
		<li>Attribute values in models in result sets from Waterline are now cast to numbers, if they are number-looking strings.</li>
		<li>Substantial refactoring of waterline model-augmentation logic.</li>
		<li>Added TODO for asynchronous module loading for future.</li>
		<li>Upgraded waterline-dirty dep.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>0.8.77</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Patch updates the waterline-dirty dependency to deal with an issue with that adapter returning objects which map directly to the in-memory database (was causing changes made to found models to be persisted without calling .save())</li>
	</ul>
