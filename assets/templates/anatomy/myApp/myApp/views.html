<p>This is the directory that holds all of your custom views.  </p>
<p>To create a custom view, create a new directory inside of this then create a new .ejs file.  In order for it to be rendered by a client, you must either set up a route in <code>myApp/config/routes.js</code> or use the <code>res.view()</code> method inside of a custom controller action.</p>
